# jsfuck
An implementation of [JSFuck](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JSFuck) written in rust.

## Why?
I was bored. I saw this online, written in JS. Rust, being the obviously superior alternative, should have been employed. I am here to do that

## But others have done this before
"bUt OtHeRs HaVe" I dont care. This is my silly little project, just for fun and practice.
