# **Ja**vascript **R**ust JS**F**uck **E**ngine

An implementation of [JSFuck](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JSFuck) written in rust.

## Why?

I was bored. I saw this online, written in JS. Rust, being the obviously superior alternative, should have been employed. I am here to do that

## But others have done this before

"bUt OtHeRs HaVe" I dont care. This is my silly little project, just for fun and practice.

## How to use

Just run `jarfe -h` to see the help message. It will tell you how to use it. It's pretty self-explanatory.

## Notes

-   There is currently only a linux binary available
